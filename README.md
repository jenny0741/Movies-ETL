# Movie Analysis

## Purpose
Using the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process, data was pulled from the Movie Land's website to create two datasets. These datasets (movies and ratings) will be used for Amazing Prime's hackathon, a competition to predict which movie will become popular. An automated pipeline was created to constantly take in new data, transform it and load it into existing tables in order to keep the datasets updated daily.
